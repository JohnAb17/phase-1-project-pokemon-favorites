Eeveelution Fans!!!

A web app meant to pull up details on specific fan-favorite Pokemons from the Eevee evolution tree. The only search results that will function will be for those pokemon found in the Eevee evolution line. If you need help finding the names of these pokemon, here's a link to help with that: https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Eevee_(Pok%C3%A9mon) . While on the site, scroll down until you reach a chart depicting the various evolutions in the Eevee pokemon line. 

The imageAI Stablecog was used to generate realistic images of the pokemon to use freely within this web app without copyright restrictions. Using some creative input, users are able to develop one of a kind images built by this imageAI. You can be as specific as possible (A clown running around the park, holding an ice cream cone, while a little girl in a pink dress is crying in the background, because she dropped her ice cream) to create an even more refined image, but you can use a few simple words (A bird is flying above a worm) to still develop one of a kind art pieces.

Usage: 
1. To go to my project, first you must click on this link to get started: https://johnab17.github.io/phase-1-project-pokemon-favorites/? (This project is hosted by GitHub Pages so there's no need to download any installations)
2. Type in the name of the Eeveelution you'd liked to see (example: Umbreon) , or if you don't fully recall the name, try typing out most of it's name or a letter that is within the name of your favorite Eeveelution
3. Hit the submit button, or click the 'Enter' key once you've typed into the search bar
4. Your chosen pokemon(s) should be displayed as the only card(s) now on the web app
5. For your added viewing pleasure, there is a way to view the image larger than it is, and you simple hover your mouse over the card to do so.

Roadmap: 
1. Add images for the various types of pokemon featured on the web app to increase aesthetic
2. Improve the web app by adding a few more Pokemon related items, such as custom background that uses similiar artstyle to the original art of these pokemon
3. Add a new ability for users to see what happens to Eevee when given a certain elemental stone which is used to evolve it 
4. Add images for these stones to accompany the text, and then the evolution result if that particular stone is used
5. Explain to the users why 2 of the evolutions don't use stones, and instead use kindness to evolve during different times of the day
6. Add an image on the webapp that shows all Eevee evolutions together to create a 'cute' aesthetic as well as to show all possible evolutions to intrigue the user to finding out more of each individual pokemon
